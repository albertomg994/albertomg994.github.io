Recently I went to my first two hackathons. Just in case some of you don't know
what is this, I'll explain it:

A **hackathon** is a contest where teams (or individuals) have to develop some
kind of MVP about a given topic in a 24-hour time period (usually). If I had to
choose a word to define it, that'd be **RUSH**.

Even tough the most common profile you can find in a hackathon are people related
to computer science, it's not limited to that and specially depending on the
given topic for the contest you can find people coming from completely different
backgrounds.

In the ones I went to, after developing your product the team had to do a
*five-minutes* pitch in front of a group of judges. **Five minutes**. I'll say
it again because it's easy to overestimate the meaning of this: **five**.

When you mix techies who enjoy spending time hacking on complicated stuff nobody
else understands with a mostly non-technical group of judges, you get to the
following conclusion: you'd better explain what you've done in a way they can
feel it's providing some kind of value, otherwise your goose is cooked.

In fact you're warned several times during the contest about this fact, but I
think that for me it's going to be one of those things you end up learning by
trial an error.
